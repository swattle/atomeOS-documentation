## About atomeOS

atomeOS enables eco-friendly computing out of the box to help reduce your carbon footprint by prolonging battery life, reducing resource load and power usage,
and can even revive older computers without sacrificing the aesthetics or performance of the operating system. 

Clever power management algorithms were employed to achieve this efficiency by defaulting the least time taking configurations based on the processor and environment.

Built on top of the Linux kernel and utilizes LXQt desktop environment. Compatible only with 64-bit architecture.

Check out [here](https://www.discoverswattle.com/atomeOS#build-process) to know how its built.

## System Requirements

atomeOS is a good operating system for many old computers, but not for all of them. Some computers have too little horsepower or memory. A rule of thumb is that 
the computer should not be more than 15 years old.

* Memory (RAM) 
> For advanced internet services like Netflix, YouTube, Google Drive, and Facebook, your computer needs at least 1 GB of RAM.

> For local programs like Libre Office and simple browsing habits, your computer needs at least 512 MB of RAM.

* Processor (CPU) 
> The minimum specification for CPU is Pentium 4 or Pentium M or AMD K8. Older processors are too slow and the AMD K7 has problems with Flash video.
